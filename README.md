NGDCS Flight Line Capture Software

NGDCS software is used onboard the AVIRIS Next Gen instrument family of imaging spectrometers designed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This code is being made available here in hopes that it will foster greater collaborations within the imaging spectroscopy community. Some portions of the code had to be removed due to license restrictions. Removed code includes the Alpha Data hardware drivers as well as the Andor camera driver. The AlphaData and Andor folders contain the relevant information as to where said code can be obtained.
